NBA-analysis

Our dataset contains data on shots taken during the 2014-2015 season, who took the shot, where on the floor was the shot taken from, who was the nearest defender, how far away was the nearest defender, time on the shot clock, and much more.  It will be useful for evaluating who the best shooter is, who the best defender is, the hot-hand hypothesis, etc.
